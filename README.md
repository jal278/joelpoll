Detailed description [here](https://worldbetter.svbtle.com/roll-your-own-political-poll-on-mechanical-turk)

analyze_survey.py does all the hard analysis work -- and can be tweaked if you want to explore the data further or improve the matching algorithm (which probably does need improvement)

census_sample_generator.ipynb is a ipython3 notebook, and will require you to download some census data if you want to generate new census samples. 

raw_data.csv contains the anonymized survey responses
